# Summary

**NanoBox -- Connectors' Edition**

A remix of the [NanoBox Case](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3518410) for the **Nvidia Jetson Nano Developer Kit** with more precut slots for connecting stuff.

Apart from the slot for the expansion header already in the original NanoBox, this version includes precut openings for:
- Serial port header,
- Camera connector,
- Fan header,
- SMA antennas.

I didn't add a specific opening for the button header because their cables can easily fit through the adjacent serial or camera slots, and 6mm toggle switches and buttons can be mounted on the SMA openings.

Several configurations are possible for the antennas, see the photos for some potential arrangements. The antennas shown are from the **Intel 8265 Desktop Wireless M.2 Kit**.

The model shown in the photos was printed on a **PRUSA I3 MK3** using 0.2mm layers. Filaments are PLA **Bq grey** and **Winbo orange**. Prints without supports.

Enjoy!

**UPDATE** 24/MAY/2019: [Bluecake](https://www.thingiverse.com/bluecake/about) pointed out printing this model in ABS is quite a challenge. I made a new version that should be easier to print: [Jetson Nano Case - ABS Edition](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3649612)
